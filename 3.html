<h2> Javascript </h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and
multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide
 Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web
  applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and
  all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
 It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM,
  but the language itself does not include any I/O,
   such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities,
relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded. </p>
